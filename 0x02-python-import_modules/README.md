# Python Import and Modules

This repository contains solutions for tasks related to the topic of Python import and modules. Each task focuses on different aspects of working with modules, importing functions, and utilizing command line arguments. The goal of this project is to enhance your understanding of Python programming and its features.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will be able to:

- Understand why Python programming is awesome.
- Import functions from another file.
- Use imported functions effectively.
- Create your own module.
- Utilize the built-in function `dir()`.
- Prevent code in your script from being executed when imported.
- Use command line arguments with your Python programs.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8.5
- Pycodestyle 2.8.* (for code style compliance)
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `0-add.py`: Program that imports the `add` function from `add_0.py` and prints the result of the addition.
- `add_0.py`: File containing the `add` function.
- `1-calculation.py`: Program that imports functions from `calculator_1.py`, performs calculations, and prints the results.
- `calculator_1.py`: File containing calculator functions.
- `2-args.py`: Program that prints the number of arguments passed and the list of arguments.
- `3-infinite_add.py`: Program that prints the result of the addition of all command line arguments.
- `4-hidden_discovery.py`: Program that prints all names defined in the compiled module `hidden_4.pyc`.
- `hidden_4.pyc`: Compiled module with hidden names.
- `5-variable_load.py`: Program that imports the variable `a` from `variable_load_5.py` and prints its value.
- `variable_load_5.py`: File containing the variable `a`.

## Usage

To run any of the programs, use the following command:


Replace `<filename>` with the name of the program you want to run.

## Style Guide

Please ensure that your code follows the Pycodestyle style guide to maintain consistency and readability.
