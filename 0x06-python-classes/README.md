# 0x06. Python - Classes and Objects

## Description
This project covers the topic of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. It introduces the concept of classes and objects, and explores various aspects of OOP, such as attributes, methods, encapsulation, and inheritance.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Explain the advantages of Python programming.
- Understand the basics of OOP and its key concepts.
- Differentiate between classes, objects, and instances.
- Define attributes and use access modifiers.
- Implement methods and the special `__init__` method.
- Apply data abstraction, encapsulation, and information hiding.
- Utilize properties, getters, and setters.
- Dynamically create attributes for existing instances.
- Access and update private attributes.
- Calculate the area of a square.
- Print a square using the `my_print` method.
- Handle coordinates of a square.

## Project Tasks
### Task 0: My first square
Write an empty class `Square` that defines a square.

### Task 1: Square with size
Write a class `Square` that defines a square with a private instance attribute `size`.

### Task 2: Size validation
Update the `Square` class to include validation of the `size` attribute.

### Task 3: Area of a square
Add a public instance method `area` to the `Square` class that calculates and returns the area of the square.

### Task 4: Access and update private attribute
Update the `Square` class to use getter and setter methods for the `size` attribute.

### Task 5: Printing a square
Add a public instance method `my_print` to the `Square` class that prints a square using the `#` character.

### Task 6: Coordinates of a square
Enhance the `Square` class to include private instance attributes `
