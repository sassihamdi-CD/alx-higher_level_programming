Welcome to the world of JavaScript! In this project, you'll dive into JavaScript for both scripting and web front-end purposes. It's an exciting language with a wide range of applications, and this project will help you get familiar with its basics.

## Background Context

JavaScript is a versatile language used for both scripting tasks and web front-end development. In this project, you will focus on the scripting aspect of JavaScript, laying the foundation for future web development projects. Later, you'll use JavaScript to make dynamic web applications, such as an AirBnB project, by incorporating JavaScript and jQuery.
