# 0x07. Python - Test-driven development

## Python, UnitTests, TDD

## Concepts
For this project, we expect you to look at this concept:
- Never forget a test

## Background Context
Important notice on intranet checks for Python projects:
Starting from today:
- Based on the requirements of each task, you should always write the documentation (module(s) + function(s)) and tests first, before you actually code anything.
- The intranet checks for Python projects won’t be released before their first deadline, in order for you to focus more on TDD and think about all possible cases.
- We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case. But not in the implementation of them!
- Don’t trust the user, always think about all possible edge cases.

## Resources

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
- General
  - Why Python programming is awesome
  - What’s an interactive test
  - Why tests are important
  - How to write Docstrings to create tests
  - How to write documentation for each module and function
  - What are the basic option flags to create tests
  - How to find edge cases
